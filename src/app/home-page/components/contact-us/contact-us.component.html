                        Renewable resources are part of the renewable natural stock and comprise those resources that
                        have the potential for re-creation within a given period of time.

                        Wind and solar are very convenient, because they can be small-scale.
                        An out of the way village can use wind and solar for most of its power easily, getting rid of
                        the need to build expensive power plants.
